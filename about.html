    <h1>About STUDIHARDWARE</h1>
    <p>
      STUDIHARDWARE is an AI & IT Mathematics–focused research and development
      ecosystem designed to explore how artificial intelligence, computation,
      and mathematical structures can work together in modern digital systems.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to build an open ecosystem where AI logic, mathematical models,
      and information technology are combined to create transparent,
      scalable, and future-ready systems for research, education,
      and decentralized innovation.

    <h2>AI & IT Mathematics</h2>
    <p>
      At the core of STUDIHARDWARE lies the integration of:
      <br><br>
      • Mathematical reasoning and logical structures  
      <br>
      • AI-driven data analysis and automation  
      <br>
      • IT infrastructure and computational efficiency  
      <br><br>
      These components form a structured framework where algorithms,
      models, and systems evolve through continuous learning and optimization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Blockchain & Research Direction</h2>
    <p>
      STUDIHARDWARE also explores decentralized systems and blockchain-based
      research models, enabling transparent computation, open verification,
      and community-driven innovation across AI and IT mathematics.

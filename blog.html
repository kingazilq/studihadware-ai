    <h2>Understanding AI & Mathematical Structures</h2>
    <p>
      Artificial intelligence relies heavily on mathematical foundations
      such as linear algebra, probability theory, optimization, and logic.
      At STUDIHARDWARE, we explore how these mathematical components
      interact with real-world data and computational systems.

    <h2>Why IT Infrastructure Matters for AI</h2>
    <p>
      Efficient AI systems are not built on algorithms alone.
      IT infrastructure, data pipelines, system architecture,
      and computational scalability play a crucial role
      in transforming mathematical models into practical solutions.

  <section>
    <h2>Blockchain as a Computational Layer</h2>
    <p>
      Blockchain technology introduces a transparent and verifiable
      computation layer. STUDIHARDWARE examines how decentralized
      networks can support AI research, data integrity,
      and mathematical verification models.
